Presentation
============

This package provides a library written in C implementing a set of widgets
designed to view in realtime multichannels signals. Despite it has been
initially design to view signals coming from a BIOSEMI Activetwo system, it
is totally system agnostic and any user of other system might find it
useful.

is able to compile and run the library (this is the case of GNU/Linux,
Mac OS X and Windows). GTK+ 2.12 libraries or later must be installed before
compiling the package.
